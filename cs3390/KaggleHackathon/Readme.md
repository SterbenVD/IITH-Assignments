### File Details
- iith_foml_2023_train.csv is training data.
- public65962_private68233.ipynb is code 1 corresponding to one submission with mentioned score as in file name.
- public66921_private66525.ipynb is code 2 corresponding to second submission with mentioned score as in file name.
- test_input.csv is test data on which scores are based.
- test_output_65962.csv -> Submission corresponding to Public score = 65962 and Private score = 68233 on kaggle.
- test_output_66921.csv -> Submission corresponding to Public score = 66921 and Private score = 66525 on kaggle.


### Instructions

- To run the code just click on run all in the ipython notebook.
- Code contains basic libraries only - numpy, pandas and sklearn only. If this libraries is not installed you have to install it.
- It is assumed that all data are in same file as code folder.
- Paths in code are written as instructed in the classroom. However you can change that in the second code block if there is any path issue because naming of training data is not mentioned in classroom.
- Naming of the ipynb file is mentioning kaggle score of that code output.
