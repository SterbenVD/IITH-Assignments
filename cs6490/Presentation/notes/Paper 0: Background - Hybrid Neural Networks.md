# Neuromorphic Brain-Inspired Computing with Hybrid Neural Networks

## Abstract

Neuromorphic brain-inspired computing is believed to solve the bottleneck of traditional Von Neumann architecture computers and may promote the development of the next-generation of high-performance computer architectures.

## Introduction

Why?

- Lot of development of brain-inspired computing
- AGI is the goal, but we are far from it
- Large amounts of data required, called "oil"
- Demands for large-scale data processing

Problems with ANNs:

- Lack of interpretation of deep learning algorithm model process
- Lack of model robustness
- Too much reliance of intensive features

Hardware limitations:

- Moore's law is slowing down
- Size of transistors has almost reached the limit
- Communication between computing part and memory is a bottleneck

No unified standard for brain-inspired computing

Neuromorphic computing:

- Also called neuromorphic engineering
- Proposed by Carver Mead
- Mimics the structure and function of the human brain using large scale integration circuits

Human brain is a complex system:

- $10^{11}$ neurons, high parallelism
- $10^{15}$ synapses, high connectivity
- $100 Hz$ firing rate, which is low compared to the $GHz$ of modern computers
- Low power consumption of $20W$
- Low speed communication of a few $m/s$
- Highly fault-tolerant
- Learns without explicit programming

Spiking neural networks:

- Mimic the human brain
- Neurons of integration-emission type that transmit information through spikes
- Neurons do not fire continuously, only when potential reaches a threshold, which either increases or decreases the potential of the neuron
